# Space-TOML
## What is this?
A formatting-preserving TOML decoder/encoder.

## Why would I use this
To preserve the layout of your files when programmatically changing parts of your TOML configuration files. This means that all your comments are preserved, and that the data will mostly be laid out as before modification. This has the added benefit of being friendlier to version control.
